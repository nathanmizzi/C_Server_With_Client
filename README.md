# C_Server_With_Client
A Server and Client that communicate which each other, coded with C

This was an assignment for the second year of my degree course.
Essentially this program has both a client and a server, and is meant to mimic the functionality of a fitness device.

The program should work on all devices, however was programmed and tested on Linux.
